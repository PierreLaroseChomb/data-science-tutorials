    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we teach a learning algorithm to learn to perform a task by showing it examples. We want the learning algorithm to find general patterns in what it is shown, and not to memorize. We typically represent an example with a vector $x$. If we're doing supervised learning then there will also be an accompanying label $y$. Here are a few common tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: the algorithm has to predict one of $k$ possible classes. Binary classification is special case where $k = 1$. In multi-output classification, there can be more than one class.\n",
    "- **Regression**: the algorithm has to predict a real-valued output. In multi-output regression, there can be multiple real-valued outputs to predict.\n",
    "- **Denoising**: the algorithm takes as input a noisy vector $\\tilde{x}$, and has to produce a clean output vector $x$. \n",
    "- **Auto-encoding**: the algorithm takes as input $x$, and has to predict the exact same output $x$. It is however constrained by it's capacity. If the algorithm doesn't manage to reproduce an example, then that can be indicator that the input is an outlier/anomaly with respect to the training data.\n",
    "- **Density estimation**: the algorithm has to output the density $p$ of a vector $x$. In effect the learning algorithm acts as a non-parametric probability distribution that fits the data.\n",
    "- **Optimal control**: The algorithm inputs a state $s$ of the *dynamic system/environment* and has to output an action $a$ then apply it in the *dynamic system/environment* (Deep reinforcement learning). \n",
    "- **Generative models**: Generate data belonging to the training data distribution $p_{x}$, starting from a vector (usually random) $z$. GANs or diffusion models are generative models."

    "# Yet another explanation of backprop\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tutorials on backpropagation out there. I've skimmed through a bunch of them, and overall my favorite was [this one](https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2017/07/10/programming-a-neural-network-from-scratch/) by Ritchie Vink. I preferred because the code examples are of good quality and give a lot of leeway for improvement. [This](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) blogpost by Victor Zhou also helped me develop a mental model of what's going on."

    "## Neural networks in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a sequence of layers. Every layer takes as input $x$ and outputs $z$. We can denote this by a function which we call $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the input $x$ can be a set of features, as well as the output from another layer. In the case of a dense layer, $f$ is an affine transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = w x + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we stack layers, we are simply chaining functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = f(f(f(\\dots(f(x)))))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of dense layers, which are linear, chaining them essentially results in a linear function. This means that even if we have a million dense layers stacked together, we still won't be able to learn non-linear patterns such as the XOR function. To add non-linearity, we add an *activation function* after each layer. Let's call these activation functions $g$. The output from the activation functions will be called $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = g(f(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we stack layers, our final output is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = g(f(g(f(\\dots(g(f(x)))))))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many more flavors of neural networks but that's the general idea. In the case of using dense layers, we're looking to tune the weights $w$ and biases $b$. That's where backpropagation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss functions\n",
    "A loss function is a function that takes as input the output of the network $\\hat{y}$ and the ground truth $y$ and outputs a scalar value. The goal of the loss function is to indicate how far off the network is from the ground truth. The learning algorithm will then try to minimize the loss function. Here are a few examples of loss functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for general purpose regression. Penalizes large mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(y, \\hat{y}) = (y - \\hat{y}) ^ 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common loss used for classification is the cross-entropy loss. It's also called the logistic loss. It's used for binary classification, but can be extended to multi-class classification. It's also used for estimating probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(y, p) = log(1 + exp(-yp))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisson loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for estimating counts (arrivals in an airport, number of call events to call center, etc.), which is a specific case of regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(y, \\hat{y}) = \\hat{y} - y \\times log(\\hat{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hinge loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(y, p) = max(0, 1 - yp)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss functions have a big impact on the learning algorithm. For instance the only difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression is a linear model with a squared loss whereas logistic regression is a linear model with a logistic loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more loss functions that you can use in machine learning. You can even design your own! For example the deep learning community introduced the [focal loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) to deal with imbalanced datasets. Vowpal Wabbit also [designed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1576) a set of loss functions that support importance weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's get the chain rule out of the way. Say you have a function $f$, a function $g$, and an input $x$. If we compose our functions and apply them to $x$ we get $g(f(x))$. Now say we want to find the derivative of $g$ with respect to $x$. The trick is that there the function $f$ in between $g$ and $x$. In this case we use the chain rule, which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial f} \\times \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in order to compute $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}$, we have to compute $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial f}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and multiply them together. The chain rule is thus just a tool that we can add to our toolkit. In the case of neural networks it's super useful because we're basically just chaining functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're looking at the weights of the final layer. We'll call them $w$. The output of the network is denoted as $\\hat{y}$ whilst the ground truth is $y$. We have a loss function $L$ which indicates the error between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$. To update the weights, we need to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In between $w_i$ and $L$, there is the application of the dense layer and the activation function. We can thus apply the chain rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} \\times \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial z} \\times \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where our loss function is the mean squared error, the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} = 2 \\times (a - y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sigmoid activation function, the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial z} = \\sigma(z) (1 - \\sigma(z))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is in fact the sigmoid function. In the case of a dense layer, the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial w} = x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply have to multiply all these elements together in order to obtain $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} = (2 \\times (a - y)) \\times (\\sigma(z) (1 - \\sigma(z))) \\times x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $a$ is the output of the network after having been processed by the activation function. We could have as well called it $\\hat{y}$ because we're looking at the final layer, but we use $a$ because it's more generic and applies to each layer in the network. $z$ is the output of the network *before* being processed by the activation function. Note that implementation wise we thus have to keep both in memory. We can't just obtain $a$ and erase $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plug in a different activation function and/or a different loss function, then everything will still work as long as each element is differentiable. Note that if we use the identity activation function (which doesn't change the input and has a derivative of 1), then we're simply doing linear regression!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how about the weights of the penultimate layer (the one just before the last one). Well we \"just\" have write it down using the chain rule. Here goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_2} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a_3} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_3}{\\partial z_3} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_3}{\\partial a_2} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_2}{\\partial z_2} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial w_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We've indexed the $a$s and $z$s because we're looking at multiple layer. In this case $a_3$ is the output of the 3rd layer (we called it $a$ before) whilst $a_2$ is the output of the 2nd layer. An important thing to notice is that we're using $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a_3} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_3}{\\partial z_3}$, which we already calculated previously. We can exploit this when we implement backpropagation in order to speed up our code but also make it shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the gradients for the weights of the 1st layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_2} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a_3} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_3}{\\partial z_3} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_3}{\\partial a_2} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_2}{\\partial z_2} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_2}{\\partial a_1} \\times \\frac{\\partial a_1}{\\partial z_1} \\times \\frac{\\partial z_1}{\\partial w_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again the first four elements of the product have already been computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "How about the biases $b_i$? Well in a dense layer the derivative with respect to the biases is 1 (it was $x$ with respect to the weights). For the 3rd layer this will result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial b} = (2 \\times (a - y)) \\times (\\sigma(z) (1 - \\sigma(z))) \\times 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each observation $(x_i, y_i)$, the gradient $\\nabla_i$ is obtained\n",
    "2. An optimizer takes care of obtaining the new weights $w_{i+1}$ by modifying the current weights $w_i$ and using the current gradient $\\nabla_i$\n",
    "3. We can loop multiple times through the dataset; each iteration is called an **epoch**\n",

    "# How di I choose the architecture of my neural network ?\n",
    "There are so many choices you can make that it can quickly become overwhelming. Choosing the right pieces of the puzzle is very much an art rather than a science. There is no getting around trying things out. It is thus very important to setup a stable environment for testing and evaluating model choices. You should always start by defining a reliable testing procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some general advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a very simple model (for example a logistic regression)\n",
    "2. Add complexity to the model as long as the validation score improves\n",
    "3. If the model is overfitting (you can detect it by comparing the training and validation scores) then add regularization\n",
    "4. Last but not least, spend most of your time checking that the data you're using is correct\n",
